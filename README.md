# System Requirements
## Hardware Requirements
The lol package requires only a standard computer with enough RAM to support the operations defined by a user. For minimal performance, this will be a computer with about 2 GB of RAM. For optimal performance, we recommend a computer with the following specs:

RAM: 16+ GB
CPU: 4+ cores, 3.3+ GHz/core

The runtimes below are generated using a computer with the recommended specs (16 GB RAM, 4 cores@3.3 GHz) and internet of speed 25 Mbps.

## Software Requirements
OS Requirements
The package development version is tested on Linux operating systems. The developmental version of the package has been tested on the following systems:

Linux: Ubuntu 16.04

which should install in about 20 seconds.
